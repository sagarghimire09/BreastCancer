Mammography is the process of using low-energy X-rays to examine the human breast for diagnosis and screening.
The goal of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer.

Breast cancer can be diagnosed by classifying tumors. There are two different types of
tumors such as malignant and benign tumors

Afzan Adam[28] et al. have developed a computerized breast cancer diagnosis by
combining genetic algorithm and Back propagation neural network which was developed as faster
classifier model to reduce the diagnose time as well as increasing the accuracy in classifying mass
in breast to either benign or malignant

In Set A, it only eliminated records with missing values, while set B was trained
with normal statistical cleaning process to identify any noisy or missing values. At last Set A gave
100% of highest accuracy percentage and set B gave 83.36% of accuracy.

Hence the author has
concluded that medical data are best kept in its original value as it gives high accuracy percentage
as compared to altered data.

Many researchers have applied the algorithm of neural networks for predicting cancers,especially the breast cancer.
By going through various articles,RVM is applied for detecting optical cancer,ovarian cancer etc.
